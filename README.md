# To-do web app

## About :thought_balloon:
The task was to implement a simple to-do list app, as given by the specification from
[Tim Buchalka's Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-spring-framework-masterclass/) from Udemy. 
I have improved the course app with a database for data permanence.

## Features :white_check_mark:
The app has the following features:
 - Allows the basic CRUD operations for the to-do items.
 - Database support means that information will be kept secure and not lost when the application is stopped.

## Implementation and GUI :computer:

### Notable implementation details
- Spring Boot used for building the backend.
- Architecture pattern, logic separated into packages: service, controller, data, model and util.
- JSP used for rendering the view
